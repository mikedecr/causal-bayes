## About this repo

It probably doesn't work to build it yourself from scratch yet. See 'technical' section in to-do list

## To do

Legwork

- WIPs (Hall)
  - [x] Decide which interventions (unif, logit)
  - [ ] Priors and PPCs (?)
  - [x] Estimate 
  - [ ] Diagnoses (appendix)
  - [x] Posterior figs
  - [ ] Posterior R inline
  - [ ] Replace "intro" code with brm (or clean it up, whatever)
- Pooling / Regularization (Reeves et al)
  - [x] Which priors
  - [ ] PPCs into paper somewhere (ugh)
  - [x] Estimate
  - [ ] Diagnosis (appendix)
  - [x] Posteriors
- Regularized conjoint (cut)
  - [ ] Decide if this is gonna make it


Writing

- [ ] Feedback solicitation
  - What's the audience
  - What's the purpose (argument vs. explanation vs. tactical demonstration)
  - What needs more careful explanation or (yuck) "hand-holding"
- [x] Intro
  - onboarding in the right place?
- [x] Shared goals
- [x] Norm clash
- [x] Examples
- [ ] Going forward
  - Nonparametrics?
  - Bayesian ML tactics?
  - Sensitivity testing
  - Marginalizing over choices (mediation sensitivity parameter, matching, assumptions)

Reverse outline
